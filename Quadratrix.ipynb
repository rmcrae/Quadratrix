    "The Greek idea of determining area was not like our modern idea of determining some numeric quantity associated with a figure, but rather that of determining the *square* that has the same area as that of the figure.  It was well known how to construct (again, with straight edge and compass techniques) the square associated with any rectilinear figure; the outstanding question was how to do this (in general) for curvilinear figures and (specifically) for the circle.  The first person historically associated with this problem was the Ionian philosopher Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (~500-428 BC), who worked on the problem during his prison term (for suggesting that the sun was not a deity...).  Many others followed his attempts, all of whom failed (for the best of reasons).\n",
